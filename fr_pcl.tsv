In a poor country like the Philippines where wages are low and work is cheap, the collegial education of a family member, especially for the poor, is their only outcome of poverty. It is also the only way in which the future family of that same family member could be freed from the bourbier of poverty that has engulfed his family for generations. It is about social mobility. And if more poor families are freed from poverty, would that not reflect the development of Philippine society?	1
