In a poor country such as the Philippines, where wages are low and the work is cheap, the college education of a member of a family, especially for the poor, is their only way out of poverty. It is also the only way through which the future family of the same family member could get out of the swamp of poverty that enveloped his or her family for generations. It is about social mobility. And if more poor families break free of poverty, would that not reflect on the development of the Philippine society?	1
